# RAG Q&A Conversation With PDF Including Chat History

This project integrates **Streamlit**, **Groq**, and **Langchain** to provide a Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Users can upload PDF documents, and the system allows interaction with the content by asking questions, all while maintaining chat history for context-aware responses.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnimeshBasak-14/rag-qa-chat-with-pdf-and-history.git
    cd rag-qa-chat-with-pdf-and-history
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key and HuggingFace token:

    ```
    HF_TOKEN=<your_huggingface_token>
    ```

    Replace `<your_huggingface_token>` with your HuggingFace API key.
